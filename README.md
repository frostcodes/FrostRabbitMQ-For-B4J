# Frost RabbitMQ

FrostRabbitMQ is an advanced B4J wrapper for the [RabbitMQ Java Client](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-java-client) library.  
It enables B4X developers to integrate AMQP messaging into their applications using RabbitMQ easily.

With FrostRabbitMQ, you can build scalable, event-driven applications.

This library was built on top of the wonderful work of Magma(Georgios Kantzas):
